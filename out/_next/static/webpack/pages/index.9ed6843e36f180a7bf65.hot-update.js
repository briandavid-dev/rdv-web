It is not known whether the name of the rum originated from that word or the scientific name of sugarcane: Saccharum Officiarum. The first document mentioning it dates from July 8, 1661. It was issued by the governor of Jamaica and in that text it was simply called \\\"rum\\u201D.\",\n  parrafo3: \"Dave Broom in his book titled Rum points out that: \\\"At first rum was a native drink designed for servants.\\\" In the 17th and 18th centuries it served as currency to buy slaves that worked in the sugarcane fields. Until the end of the 18th century, it was the drink of choice for sailors. In 1693 a Dominican rum scholar, Father Jean-Baptiste Labat, perfected the still and put into practice the method used for cognac.  The result revolutionized the rum industry in the French colonies. \",\n  parrafo4: \"Pirates and filibusters loved rum and on the islands it became omnipresent.

This antecedent allowed the history of rum in the country to begin early, in the 19th century. Beginning in 1880, high import duties and low taxes on domestic production helped its production. Then, rums from Car\\xFApano obtained a leading role. There not only did common rum thrive. So did \\\"el Ron Viejo Car\\xFApano\\\".

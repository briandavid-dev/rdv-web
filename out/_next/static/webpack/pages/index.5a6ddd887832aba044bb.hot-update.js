  pageTitle: "Our History | Rum from Venezuela",
  titulo: "Our History",
  parrafo1: "The history of rum began with the arrival of the Europeans since they brought the sugarcane which had the Dominican Republic as its first domicile and the Caribbean Sea as a neighbor. This plant was part of the luggage that accompanied Christopher Columbus, on his second trip to America, in 1493.  ",
  parrafo2: "In the history of rum the pirates also have their chapter, as they brought to the West Indies a drink they made from sugarcane juice which they called Kill-Devil or rumbellion, which means tumult. It is not known whether the name of the rum originated from that word or the scientific name of sugarcane: Saccharum Officiarum. The first document mentioning it dates from July 8, 1661. It was issued by the governor of Jamaica and in that text it was simply called \"rum\u201D.",
  parrafo3: "Dave Broom in his book titled Rum points out that: \"At first rum was a native drink designed for servants.\" In the 17th and 18th centuries it served as currency to buy slaves that worked in the sugarcane fields. Until the end of the 18th century, it was the drink of choice for sailors. In 1693 a Dominican rum scholar, Father Jean-Baptiste Labat, perfected the still and put into practice the method used for cognac.  The result revolutionized the rum industry in the French colonies. ",
  parrafo4: "Pirates and filibusters loved rum and on the islands it became omnipresent. Spiced rum punch became the sailor\u2019s favorite drink. Later, it arrived in England where people were drinking it hot. As that punch spread across Europe, rum left behind its less than honorable past and ascended to other social classes. ",
  parrafo5: "Venezuela distilled its own history that adds up to two centuries of tradition. Sugarcane arrived in Venezuela with the Spanish conquerors, which used it to sweeten and make their juices, predecessors of rum.",
  parrafo6: "There are indications that sugarcane arrived in Venezuela through Coro. In the 18th century, \"almost everyone expressed that it was the second fruit in these lands,\" says Jos\xE9 Angel Rodr\xEDguez in the book Our Gastronomic Culture. And where there's sugar, there's the drink that come from it. \"Where the sugar germinated, hard liquor or \u201Caguardiente\u201D is distilled\" recalls the historian.",
  parrafo7: "The \u201Caguardiente\u201D prospered in the 18th century in Venezuela because the Spanish colony, to protect the peninsular wines, forbade its production. This antecedent allowed the history of rum in the country to begin early, in the 19th century. Beginning in 1880, high import duties and low taxes on domestic production helped its production. Then, rums from Car\xFApano obtained a leading role. There not only did common rum thrive. So did \"el Ron Viejo Car\xFApano\". The distillers kept the rum in barrels taken from European wines waiting for a better opportunity regarding prices. And by doing so, they realized how well they were aging.",
  parrafo8: "In the 19th century there was rum not only in Car\xFApano, state of Sucre; but also in Zulia, Miranda, Carabobo, Aragua, Yaracuy, Cojedes, Gu\xE1rico, in the Andean states and in the capital region of Venezuela. Rum was concentrated in urban areas, while \u201Caguardiente\u201D thrived in rural areas.",
  parrafo9: "Subsequently, other names emerged that have been consolidating in the country and are projecting with a solid image abroad because they offer the consumer more than quality, in their bottles there is history. A history that fed a collection of anecdotes that gave Venezuelan rum a trajectory of more than two centuries of tradition."

  titulo: `Our History`,
  parrafo1: `The history of rum began with the arrival of the Europeans since they brought the sugarcane which had the Dominican Republic as its first domicile and the Caribbean Sea as a neighbor. This plant was part of the luggage that accompanied Christopher Columbus, on his second trip to America, in 1493.  `,
  parrafo2: `In the history of rum the pirates also have their chapter, as they brought to the West Indies a drink they made from sugarcane juice which they called Kill-Devil or rumbellion, which means tumult. It is not known whether the name of the rum originated from that word or the scientific name of sugarcane: Saccharum Officiarum. The first document mentioning it dates from July 8, 1661. It was issued by the governor of Jamaica and in that text it was simply called "rum”.`,
  parrafo3: `Dave Broom in his book titled Rum points out that: "At first rum was a native drink designed for servants." In the 17th and 18th centuries it served as currency to buy slaves that worked in the sugarcane fields. Until the end of the 18th century, it was the drink of choice for sailors. In 1693 a Dominican rum scholar, Father Jean-Baptiste Labat, perfected the still and put into practice the method used for cognac.  The result revolutionized the rum industry in the French colonies. `,
  parrafo4: `Pirates and filibusters loved rum and on the islands it became omnipresent. Spiced rum punch became the sailor’s favorite drink. Later, it arrived in England where people were drinking it hot. As that punch spread across Europe, rum left behind its less than honorable past and ascended to other social classes. `,
  parrafo5: `Venezuela distilled its own history that adds up to two centuries of tradition. Sugarcane arrived in Venezuela with the Spanish conquerors, which used it to sweeten and make their juices, predecessors of rum.`,
  parrafo6: `There are indications that sugarcane arrived in Venezuela through Coro. In the 18th century, "almost everyone expressed that it was the second fruit in these lands," says José Angel Rodríguez in the book Our Gastronomic Culture. And where there's sugar, there's the drink that come from it. "Where the sugar germinated, hard liquor or “aguardiente” is distilled" recalls the historian.`,
  parrafo7: `The “aguardiente” prospered in the 18th century in Venezuela because the Spanish colony, to protect the peninsular wines, forbade its production. This antecedent allowed the history of rum in the country to begin early, in the 19th century. Beginning in 1880, high import duties and low taxes on domestic production helped its production. Then, rums from Carúpano obtained a leading role. There not only did common rum thrive. So did "el Ron Viejo Carúpano". The distillers kept the rum in barrels taken from European wines waiting for a better opportunity regarding prices. And by doing so, they realized how well they were aging.`,
  parrafo8: `In the 19th century there was rum not only in Carúpano, state of Sucre; but also in Zulia, Miranda, Carabobo, Aragua, Yaracuy, Cojedes, Guárico, in the Andean states and in the capital region of Venezuela. Rum was concentrated in urban areas, while “aguardiente” thrived in rural areas.`,
  parrafo9: `Subsequently, other names emerged that have been consolidating in the country and are projecting with a solid image abroad because they offer the consumer more than quality, in their bottles there is history. A history that fed a collection of anecdotes that gave Venezuelan rum a trajectory of more than two centuries of tradition.`,

        juice from which crystalizing sugar has been extracted at the sugar
        mills. Venezuelan molasses contains more sugar and fewer impurities,
        which influences the quality of the alcohol. The more sugar there is in
        the molasses, the higher the elements of quality in the alcohol. The
        Denomination of Origin determines that the molasses have to be from
        Venezuela in order to present its peculiar characteristics.

          In Venezuela to be called rum it has to be aged in barrels for two
          years. Since there is sun all year round, aging is intense,
          evaporation, as well as oxidation is higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each type of alcohol has its aging potential. There are light alcohols
          that cannot be aged more than two years, while a heavy one requires
          perhaps more than four. That is why there is talk about maturing them
          to their optimum age.
        </p>
        <p>
          By law, in Venezuela, if you want to indicate the age of blended rum,
          that of the rum with less age should be used. When it comes to the
          barrels for aging, they should be from white oak, which were usually
          previously used to age American bourbon or Scotch whisky.

          Venezuelan rums are usually the result of a blend of rums of different
          ages that is made to obtain a distillate that is superior to each one
          of those parts. The blends are made by the master Rum-Makers or
          “Maestros Roneros” who possess a trained sense of smell and experience
          that amounts to decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          These mixes give personality to the blend. In the case of heavy rums
          the blend is usually the result of the union of younger rums. If you
          climb the scale to the premiums, in their formula there are older
          rums. Final adjustments are made to finish the process. Each rum
          company has its own secret touches.

          expertise and knowledge in the art of distillation, formulation and
          aging and a careful selection of the best raw materials, allowed
          Nestor to create the best spirits that, subsequently, made it the best
